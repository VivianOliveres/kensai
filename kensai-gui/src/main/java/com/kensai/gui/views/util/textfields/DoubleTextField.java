 * in the field or the value of the DoubleProperty change, the other is updated to match it.

 * Note that this class should not be used in conjunction with values that would be better represented by an
 * IntegerProperty or a LongProperty. Examples of these include indices and counts, since such values are more precisely
 * represented by binary integers. In such a case, a modification of this class should be used or made.
